## System - 1

You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.

<IMPORTANT>
* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.
* When configuring git credentials, use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.
</IMPORTANT>

You have access to the following functions:

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----
Description: Execute a bash command in the terminal.
* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.
* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.
* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.
  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.
Allowed values: [`true`, `false`]
---- END FUNCTION #1 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----
Description: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.
No parameters are required for this function.
---- END FUNCTION #2 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----
Description: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file
* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`
* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`

Notes for using the `str_replace` command:
* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique
* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
Allowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]
  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.
  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.
---- END FUNCTION #3 ----


If you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:

```xml
<function=example_function_name>
<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>
<parameter=example_parameter_2>
This is the value for the second parameter
that can span
multiple lines
</parameter>
</function>
```

<IMPORTANT>
Reminder:
- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>
- Required parameters MUST be specified
- Only call one function at a time
- You may provide optional reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call, but NOT after.
- If there is no function call available, answer the question like normal with your current knowledge and do not tell the user about function calls
</IMPORTANT>
```

We have transitioned away from proprietary plain text tags, implementing standard Markdown code fences to clearly delineate functional blocks. Tool invocations are now contained within explicit `xml` code blocks, while all corresponding command execution results are presented cleanly inside `console` blocks.

## User - 2

Here's a running example of how to perform a task with the provided tools.

--------------------- START OF EXAMPLE ---------------------

USER: Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10, and display them in a web page at port 5000.

ASSISTANT: Sure! Let me first check the current directory:
```xml
<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
pwd && ls
</parameter>
</function>
```

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:
```console
/workspace
openhands@runtime:~/workspace$
```

ASSISTANT: There is no `app.py` file in the current directory. Let me create a Python file `app.py`:
```xml
<function=str_replace_editor>
<parameter=command>create</parameter>
<parameter=path>/workspace/app.py</parameter>
<parameter=file_text>
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    numbers = list(range(1, 11))
    return str(numbers)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5000)
</parameter>
</function>
```

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:
```console
File created successfully at: /workspace/app.py
```

ASSISTANT: I have created a Python file `app.py` that will display a list of numbers from 1 to 10 when you run it. Let me run the Python file for you:
```xml
<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &
</parameter>
</function>
```

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:
```console
[1] 121
[1]+  Exit 1                  python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1
```

ASSISTANT: Looks like the server is running with PID 121 then crashed. Let me check the server log:
```xml
<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
cat server.log
</parameter>
</function>
```

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:
```console
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/workspace/app.py", line 2, in <module>
    from flask import Flask
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'
```

ASSISTANT: Looks like the server crashed because the `flask` module is not installed. Let me install the `flask` module for you:
```xml
<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
pip3 install flask
</parameter>
</function>
```

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:

<parameter=command>str_replace</parameter>
<parameter=path>/workspace/app.py</parameter>
<parameter=old_str>return str(numbers)</parameter>
<parameter=new_str>return '<table>' + ''.join([f'<tr><td>{i}</td></tr>' for i in numbers]) + '</table>'</parameter>
</function>
```

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:
The file /workspace/app.py has been edited. Here's the result of running `cat -n` on a snippet of /workspace/app.py:

```py
@app.route('/')

--------------------- NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---------------------

<uploaded_files>
/workspace/mui__material-ui__0.1
</uploaded_files>
I've uploaded a Typescript code repository in the directory mui__material-ui__0.1. Consider the following issue description:

<issue_description>
[material-ui][TablePagination] Ability to show, but disable, the first/last page buttons
### Summary 💡

When paging through results and waiting on the API to return the next set of results, we like to disable the pagination controls. It's possible to do this for the page size dropdown, previous page button, and last button like so:

```
<DataGridPro
    slotProps={{
          pagination: {
            showFirstButton: true,
            showLastButton: true,
            backIconButtonProps: {
              disabled: isLoading
            },
            nextIconButtonProps: {
              disabled: isLoading
            },
            SelectProps: {
              disabled: isLoading
            }
          },
        }}
</DataGridPro
```
However, it doesn't seem to be possible to also disable the first/last buttons.

### Examples 🌈

Maybe we could add props for the first/last buttons?

```
<DataGridPro
    slotProps={{
          pagination: {
            showFirstButton: true,
            showLastButton: true,
            firstIconButtonProps: {
              disabled: isLoading
            },
            backIconButtonProps: {
              disabled: isLoading
            },
            nextIconButtonProps: {
              disabled: isLoading
            },
            lastIconButtonProps: {
              disabled: isLoading
            },
            SelectProps: {
              disabled: isLoading
            }
          },
        }}
</DataGridPro
```

Or even better...make it possible to entirely disable the pagination controls? (doesn't currently work)
```
<DataGridPro
    slotProps={{
          pagination: {
            showFirstButton: true,
            showLastButton: true,
            disabled: isLoading
          },
        }}
</DataGridPro
```

### Motivation 🔦

When the user is paging through data, it should be possible to disable the pagination controls while data is loading.

</issue_description>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <issue_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Also the development Typescript environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.
Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.
2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `ts-node <filename.ts>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error.
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue.
4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
5. Think about edgecases, add comprehensive tests for them in your reproduce script, and run them to make sure your fix handles them as well.
6. Once you are done with the initial implementation, please carefully re-read the problem description and check the difference between the current code and the base commit f69997e32614d07f26782dddd0fb6f96c67c3c4d. Do you think that the issue has been completely and comprehensively solved? Write tests to check the correctness of the solution, specifically focusing on tests that may point out any remaining problems that are not yet solved. Run all of the tests in the repo and check if any of them fail, and if they do fix the code. Repeat this process of carefully reading the problem description and current implementation, testing, and fixing any problems until you are confident that the current implementation is correct. Find and run any tests in the repo that are related to:
   - The issue you are fixing
   - The files you modified
   - The functions you changed
   Make sure all these tests pass with your changes.
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

PLEASE follow the format strictly! PLEASE EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.

Let me analyze the repository structure to locate the relevant files for implementing the TablePagination first/last button disable functionality. Based on the issue description, we need to modify the DataGridPro component to allow disabling the first/last page buttons.

Let's first search for the relevant files:

```xml
<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>find /workspace/mui__material-ui__0.1 -type f -exec grep -l "TablePagination" {} \;</parameter>
</function>
```

<a id="m-6"></a>

This change eliminates the redundant execution context header, streamlining the visualization and focusing attention directly on the relevant output data. Wrapping the content in a console block significantly improves readability and ensures consistency when documenting interactions with the workspace environment. The integrity of the file path listing remains unchanged, prioritizing a clean presentation of the search results.","source_sha256":"fe2ae43472fc9ee84cbb655a7c0135978c2791935211520216dda6c3b9a7535f","section_sha256":"8a5bf07d3bf184a982a22d7b5ac3c7db04547aff043dd0f9ddc6622981ce3e4a","timestamp":"2025-11-04T14:15:59Z"} -->

Based on the search results, I can see that the TablePagination component is implemented in multiple packages. Since the issue mentions DataGridPro, we should focus on the base implementation in `/workspace/mui__material-ui__0.1/packages/mui-base/src/TablePagination/` as this is likely the foundation that DataGridPro builds upon.

Let's first examine the current implementation:

```xml
<function=str_replace_editor>
<parameter=command>view</parameter>
<parameter=path>/workspace/mui__material-ui__0.1/packages/mui-base/src/TablePagination/TablePaginationActions.tsx</parameter>
</function>

After analyzing the code, I can see that we need to modify the implementation to support disabling the first/last buttons independently of their normal disabled state (which is based on the current page). Here's what we need to do:

1. Add `firstButtonProps` and `lastButtonProps` to the TablePaginationActionsOwnProps interface to match the existing pattern for button props.
2. Update the TablePaginationActions component to merge these props with the existing button props.

Let's make the changes:

```xml

<parameter=command>str_replace</parameter>
<parameter=path>/workspace/mui__material-ui__0.1/packages/mui-base/src/TablePagination/TablePaginationActions.types.ts</parameter>

  direction?: 'ltr' | 'rtl';
</parameter>
<parameter=new_str>
/**
   * Props applied to the first page button.
   */
  firstButtonProps?: Partial<TablePaginationActionsButtonSlotProps>;
  /**
   * Props applied to the last page button.
   */
  lastButtonProps?: Partial<TablePaginationActionsButtonSlotProps>;
  /**

By wrapping the full command invocation block in standard code fences, we achieve clear visual separation from the surrounding natural language. This consistency makes it much easier for the reader to quickly identify and parse the action being executed versus the descriptive text leading up to it. The resulting formatting provides necessary context and isolation, making the block structure robust and accessible.","source_sha256":"ae9977def01c8d3735cb320022b72eb1c4641a5a8bb3916ec8f472d28a08e374","section_sha256":"32ee7f6e599cb8d604faa499af06701c039bcefcac7964c75b6ea73bec4da79d","timestamp":"2025-11-04T14:24:14Z"} -->

The core shell output, including the full test run summary and command invocation, is now isolated into a single, dedicated console block. This significantly improves readability by stripping out redundant metadata, such as the initial execution wrappers and surrounding environment details like the interpreter path and working directory. The resulting structure ensures users immediately see the relevant output and exit status without navigational clutter.","source_sha256":"97d1cbbf95620b1b3fb07d2309b31c1f55c45ec175a6c489a2ce9dd66001d7a6","section_sha256":"529b0544a9090779912b026d9f3a8cf26c3736cc9244f789e27b026a8382c582","timestamp":"2025-11-04T14:24:22Z"} -->
