## System - 1



You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.
* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.
* When configuring git credentials, use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.
You have access to the following functions:

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----
Description: Execute a bash command in the terminal.
* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.
* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.
* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.
  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.
Allowed values: [`true`, `false`]
---- END FUNCTION #1 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----
Description: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.
No parameters are required for this function.
---- END FUNCTION #2 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----
Description: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file
* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`
* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`

Notes for using the `str_replace` command:
* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique
* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
Allowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]
  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.
  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.
---- END FUNCTION #3 ----


If you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:

<function=example_function_name>
<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>
<parameter=example_parameter_2>
This is the value for the second parameter
that can span
multiple lines
</parameter>
</function>

<IMPORTANT>
Reminder:
- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>
- Required parameters MUST be specified
- Only call one function at a time
- You may provide optional reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call, but NOT after.
- If there is no function call available, answer the question like normal with your current knowledge and do not tell the user about function calls
</IMPORTANT>

<!-- MD-NOTES: {"id":2,"source_len":10472,"md_len":10538,"desc":"This commit addresses an issue where using an array as a value for `<option>` elements within a `<select>` tag would cause a hydration attribute mismatch during Server-Side Rendering (SSR). Previously, Vue versions before 3.4.0 handled this scenario correctly, but a regression introduced a warning in the console. This change ensures that arrays used as option values are properly serialized and deserialized, preventing the mismatch and restoring the expected behavior for SSR. The fix aligns the client-side rendering with the server-rendered output, eliminating the hydration warning.","source_sha256":"ccf02986430172b6d769f92cc4dcc0ecce42184f89c910a520276a36a579dba2","timestamp":"2025-12-07T20:22:53.810872Z"} -->

Since we're having network issues and can't install ts-node, let's compile the TypeScript file to JavaScript first and then run it with Node.js. Let's check if we have tsc available locally:

```bash
cd /workspace/vuejs__core__0.1 && ls node_modules/.bin/tsc

The file /workspace/vuejs__core__0.1/repro.ts has been edited. Here's the result of running `cat -n` on a snippet of /workspace/vuejs__core__0.1/repro.ts:

The `NOTES_FROM_AGENT1` JSON contains descriptions of changes ("makes the code snippet much easier to read and understand", "wrapping the code in a `console` block", "adding line numbers"). These do not constitute red flags as they describe formatting enhancements rather than content alteration.

Comparing the `SourceMessage.content` and the `Section` content:
The `Section` contains the exact text from `SourceMessage.content`, including the line numbers, but it is enclosed within a ```console``` code block. This is a formatting change that enhances readability and does not alter the semantic content.

Therefore, the section fully preserves the SourceMessage.content text, allowing harmless formatting.
