## System - 1



You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.
* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.
* When configuring git credentials, use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.

You have access to the following functions:

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----
Description: Execute a bash command in the terminal.
* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.
* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.
* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.
  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.
Allowed values: [`true`, `false`]
---- END FUNCTION #1 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----
Description: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.
No parameters are required for this function.
---- END FUNCTION #2 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----
Description: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file
* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`
* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`

Notes for using the `str_replace` command:
* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique
* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
Allowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]
  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.
  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.
---- END FUNCTION #3 ----


If you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:

<function=example_function_name>
<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>
<parameter=example_parameter_2>
This is the value for the second parameter
that can span
multiple lines
</parameter>
</function>

<IMPORTANT>
Reminder:
- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>
- Required parameters MUST be specified
- Only call one function at a time
- You may provide optional reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call, but NOT after.
- If there is no function call available, answer the question like normal with your current knowledge and do not tell the user about function calls
</IMPORTANT>

## User - 2

Here's a running example of how to perform a task with the provided tools.

--------------------- START OF EXAMPLE ---------------------

USER: Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10, and display them in a web page at port 5000.

ASSISTANT: Sure! Let me first check the current directory:
<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
pwd && ls
</parameter>
</function>

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:

ASSISTANT: There is no `app.py` file in the current directory. Let me create a Python file `app.py`:
<function=str_replace_editor>
<parameter=command>create</parameter>
<parameter=path>/workspace/app.py</parameter>
<parameter=file_text>
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    numbers = list(range(1, 11))
    return str(numbers)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5000)
</parameter>
</function>

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:
File created successfully at: /workspace/app.py

ASSISTANT: I have created a Python file `app.py` that will display a list of numbers from 1 to 10 when you run it. Let me run the Python file for you:
<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &
</parameter>
</function>

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:
[1] 121
[1]+  Exit 1                  python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
cat server.log
</parameter>
</function>

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:
Traceback (most recent call last):

--------------------- NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---------------------
<uploaded_files>
/workspace/mui__material-ui__0.1
</uploaded_files>
I've uploaded a Typescript code repository in the directory mui__material-ui__0.1. Consider the following issue description:

<issue_description>
InputUnstyled with 'multiline' property logs warnings for 'maxRows' and 'minRows'
### Duplicates

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Latest version

- [X] I have tested the latest version

### Current behavior 😯

When having InputUnstyled with 'multiline' logs warnings for 'maxRows' and 'minRows':

```
Warning: React does not recognize the 'minRows' prop on a DOM element. If you intentionally want it to appear in the DOM as a custom attribute, spell it as lowercase 'minrows' instead. If you accidentally passed it from a parent component, remove it from the DOM element.

Warning: React does not recognize the maxRows' prop on a DOM element. If you intentionally want it to appear in the DOM as a custom attribute, spell it as lowercase 'maxrows' instead. If you accidentally passed it from a parent component, remove it from the DOM element.
```

### Expected behavior 🤔

Should not logs an warnings.

### Steps to reproduce 🕹

Steps:

1. Have a InputUnstyled with 'multiline'
2. Check console

https://codesandbox.io/s/unstyledinput-material-demo-forked-9nqyj

### Context 🔦

I think that we need to delete this props (maxRows and minRows) which is not DOM native before we spread them in Input.

[      <Input {...inputProps} />](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/0620bb0c47c9aa52a863d8ccca5ce7352274bc65/packages/mui-base/src/InputUnstyled/InputUnstyled.tsx#L173)

</issue_description>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <issue_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Also the development Typescript environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /workspace directory so that the <issue_description> is satisfied.
Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.
2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `ts-node <filename.ts>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error.
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue.
4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
5. Think about edgecases, add comprehensive tests for them in your reproduce script, and run them to make sure your fix handles them as well.
6. Once you are done with the initial implementation, please carefully re-read the problem description and check the difference between the current code and the base commit 88db09044175734bb9f5e0fac2868e7a3ea6d485. Do you think that the issue has been completely and comprehensively solved? Write tests to check the correctness of the solution, specifically focusing on tests that may point out any remaining problems that are not yet solved. Run all of the tests in the repo and check if any of them fail, and if they do fix the code. Repeat this process of carefully reading the problem description and current implementation, testing, and fixing any problems until you are confident that the current implementation is correct. Find and run any tests in the repo that are related to:
   - The issue you are fixing
   - The files you modified
   - The functions you changed
   Make sure all these tests pass with your changes.
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

<!-- MD-NOTES: {"id":5,"source_len":989,"md_len":999,"desc":"This PR introduces improved formatting for the reproduction script, making it significantly easier to read and understand.

Reviewing the provided notes, I see mentions of "improved formatting" and "code block is now properly enclosed". These are not red flags in the sense of removing or adding content, but rather suggest formatting changes. I will now compare the content character-by-character.

The `SourceMessage.content` contains a block starting with `<function=str_replace_editor>`.
The `Section` contains a block enclosed in ````xml```` fences, and the content inside is identical to the content within the `<function=str_replace_editor>` tags in the `SourceMessage.content`.

The text content appears to be semantically equivalent. The change is the use of XML code fences instead of the custom tags, which is a formatting improvement as indicated by the notes.

```xml
<function=str_replace_editor>
function str_replace_editor(string, search, replace) {
  return string.replace(new RegExp(search, "g"), replace);
}
</function=str_replace_editor>
```

After examining the code, I can see the issue. The problem is in the multiline handling section (around line 143-176). When `multiline` is true and a native textarea is used (`hasHostTexarea` is true), the component still spreads the `minRows` and `maxRows` props to the native textarea element, which causes the React warnings since these are not valid HTML attributes.

Let's modify the code to remove these props when using a native textarea:

```xml

        type: undefined,
        maxRows: hasHostTexarea ? undefined : maxRows,
        minRows: hasHostTexarea ? undefined : minRows,
        ...inputProps,
        ...(hasHostTexarea && {
          ownerState: undefined,
        }),
      };
</parameter>
<parameter=new_str>
inputProps = {
        type: undefined,
        ...(hasHostTexarea ? {} : { maxRows, minRows }),
        ...inputProps,
        ...(hasHostTexarea && {

- **Red Flag Check**: The Notes mention "wrapped in an XML code block". While not explicitly "adding" or "removing" content, wrapping implies a change in structure. The audit needs to verify if the core content remains the same and if the wrapping is appropriate.

- **Content Comparison**:
    - SourceMessage content: `Now let's run the test script to verify our changes:\n\n<function=execute_bash>\n<parameter=command>cd /workspace/mui__material-ui__0.1 && npx ts-node ../test-input.tsx</parameter>\n</function>`
    - Section content (excluding header/anchor): `Now let's run the test script to verify our changes:\n\n```xml\n<function=execute_bash>\n<parameter=command>cd /workspace/mui__material-ui__0.1 && npx ts-node ../test-input.tsx</parameter>\n</function>\n```\n`

- **Analysis**: The text content "Now let's run the test script to verify our changes:" is identical. The core command block `<function=execute_bash>... </function>` is also present verbatim within the `xml` code fences. The original input was not in a code block, and the agent has introduced one. This is a formatting change, and the `xml` language tag is acceptable for this custom syntax. The content itself has not been altered in meaning.

- **Decision**: The content is preserved, and the introduced code block with an appropriate language tag enhances readability without altering meaning.

I see we can use `test:unit` to run our tests. However, I notice that our test file has some issues - it's using Jest syntax but the project seems to use Mocha. Let me modify the test file to use the correct testing framework:

```typescript

  const { render } = createRenderer();

  describe('prop: multiline', () => {
    let consoleWarnStub;

    beforeEach(() => {
      consoleWarnStub = sinon.stub(console, 'warn');
    });

    afterEach(() => {
      consoleWarnStub.restore();
    });

    it('should not pass minRows/maxRows to native textarea', () => {
      render(
        <InputUnstyled 
          multiline
          minRows={3}
          maxRows={5}
        />
      );

      // Check if no warnings about unrecognized props
      const warnings = consoleWarnStub.args
        .filter(args => args[0]?.includes && args[0].includes('React does not recognize'));
      
      expect(warnings.length).to.equal(0);
    });

    it('should warn when using minRows/maxRows with rows prop', () => {
      render(
        <InputUnstyled

          rows={4}
          minRows={3}
          maxRows={5}

Let's interrupt this command and try a different approach. We need to ensure our changes work correctly even if we can't run the tests directly. Let me create a simpler reproduction script that uses React DOM server-side rendering to catch any warnings:

```javascript
const React = require('react');
const ReactDOMServer = require('react-dom/server');
const InputUnstyled = require('./InputUnstyled').default;

// Store warnings
const warnings = [];
const originalWarn = console.warn;
console.warn = (...args) => {
  warnings.push(args[0]);
};

// Test cases
const testCases = [
  // Case 1: Basic multiline with minRows/maxRows
  React.createElement(InputUnstyled, {
    multiline: true,
    minRows: 3,
    maxRows: 5
  }),

  // Case 2: Multiline with rows (should warn about minRows/maxRows)
  React.createElement(InputUnstyled, {
    multiline: true,
    rows: 4,
    minRows: 3,
    maxRows: 5
  }),

  // Case 3: Non-multiline (shouldn't use minRows/maxRows)
  React.createElement(InputUnstyled, {
    minRows: 3,
    maxRows: 5
  })
];

// Run tests
testCases.forEach((element, index) => {
  console.log(`\nTesting Case ${index + 1}:`);
  warnings.length = 0;
  ReactDOMServer.renderToString(element);
  console.log('Warnings:', warnings);
});

// Restore console.warn
console.warn = originalWarn;
```

Let's try a different approach. Since we can't run the tests directly, let's verify our changes by examining the code changes we made:

1. We modified the code to not pass `minRows` and `maxRows` props to native textarea elements when `multiline` is true
2. We kept the warning when both `rows` and `minRows`/`maxRows` are used together
3. The changes look correct according to the implementation:

```typescript
if (multiline) {
  const hasHostTexarea = isHostComponent(components.Textarea ?? 'textarea');

  if (rows) {
    // Warning is preserved here
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
      if (minRows || maxRows) {
        console.warn(
          'MUI: You can not use the `minRows` or `maxRows` props when the input `rows` prop is set.',
        );
      }
    }
    inputProps = {
      type: undefined,
      ...(hasHostTexarea ? {} : { minRows: rows, maxRows: rows }),
      ...inputProps,
      ...(hasHostTexarea && {
        ownerState: undefined,
      }),
    };
  } else {
    inputProps = {
      type: undefined,
      ...(hasHostTexarea ? {} : { maxRows, minRows }),
      ...inputProps,
      ...(hasHostTexarea && {
        ownerState: undefined,
      }),
    };
  }
}
```

The changes we made ensure that:
1. When using a native textarea (`hasHostTexarea` is true), `minRows` and `maxRows` are not passed through
2. When using a custom component (`hasHostTexarea` is false), `minRows` and `maxRows` are passed through
3. The warning about using `rows` with `minRows`/`maxRows` is preserved
4. When not using `multiline`, these props are not included in the input props

Let me create a more comprehensive test that we can run in the browser to verify these changes:
