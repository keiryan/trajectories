## System - 1



You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.
* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.
* When configuring git credentials, use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.

You have access to the following functions:

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----
Description: Execute a bash command in the terminal.
* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.
* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.
* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.
  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.
Allowed values: [`true`, `false`]
---- END FUNCTION #1 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----
Description: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.
No parameters are required for this function.
---- END FUNCTION #2 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----
Description: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file
* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`
* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`

Notes for using the `str_replace` command:
* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique
* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`.

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
Allowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]
  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.
  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.
---- END FUNCTION #3 ----


If you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:

<function=example_function_name>
<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>
<parameter=example_parameter_2>
This is the value for the second parameter
that can span
multiple lines
</parameter>
</function>

<IMPORTANT>
Reminder:
- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>
- Required parameters MUST be specified
- Only call one function at a time
- You may provide optional reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call, but NOT after.
- If there is no function call available, answer the question like normal with your current knowledge and do not tell the user about function calls
</IMPORTANT>

--------------------- NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---------------------
<uploaded_files>
/workspace/mui__material-ui__0.1
</uploaded_files>
I've uploaded a Typescript code repository in the directory mui__material-material-ui__0.1. Consider the following issue description:

<issue_description>
[Breadcrumbs] Add ability to change icon used in BreadcrumbCollapsed
### Duplicates

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Latest version

- [X] I have tested the latest version

### Summary 💡

The icon used for BreadcrumbCollapsed is hard-coded to be the MUI MoreHorizon icon. This should be configurable through props for MUI consumers using a different icon library.

### Examples 🌈

Pagination exposes a `components` prop that lets consumers specify `first`, `last`, `next`, and `previous` icons.

### Motivation 🔦

We are using MUI as a base for a component library with different designs and icons. We were unable to work around this and now have inconsistency in our icons on pages with collapsible breadcrumbs.
</issue_description>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <issue_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Also the development Typescript environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.
Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.
2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `ts-node <filename.ts>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error.
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue.
4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
5. Think about edgecases, add comprehensive tests for them in your reproduce script, and run them to make sure your fix handles them as well.
6. Once you are done with the initial implementation, please carefully re-read the problem description and check the difference between the current code and the base commit e59262926c473fa1f6356f3ad150a9ca82e4ae0c. Do you think that the issue has been completely and comprehensively solved? Write tests to check the correctness of the solution, specifically focusing on tests that may point out any remaining problems that are not yet solved. Run all of the tests in the repo and check if any of them fail, and if they do fix the code. Repeat this process of carefully reading the problem description and current implementation, testing, and fixing any problems until you are confident that the current implementation is correct. Find and run any tests in the repo that are related to:
   - The issue you are fixing
   - The files you modified
   - The functions you changed
   Make sure all these tests pass with your changes.
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

PLEASE follow the format strictly! PLEASE EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.

Based on the code review, I can see that we need to modify both the BreadcrumbCollapsed component and the Breadcrumbs component to allow customization of the collapsed icon. Here's the plan:

1. First, let's modify BreadcrumbCollapsed.js to accept a custom icon component prop:

```javascript
function BreadcrumbCollapsed(props) {
  const ownerState = props;

  return (
    <li>
      <BreadcrumbCollapsedButton focusRipple {...props} ownerState={ownerState}>
        <BreadcrumbCollapsedIcon ownerState={ownerState} />
      </BreadcrumbCollapsedButton>
    </li>
  );
}
```

```javascript
function BreadcrumbCollapsed(props) {
  const { IconComponent = MoreHorizIcon, ...other } = props;
  const ownerState = { ...props, IconComponent };

  const CollapsedIcon = styled(IconComponent)({
    width: 24,
    height: 16,
  });

  return (
    <li>
      <BreadcrumbCollapsedButton focusRipple {...other} ownerState={ownerState}>
        <CollapsedIcon ownerState={ownerState} />
      </BreadcrumbCollapsedButton>
    </li>
  );
}
```

  describeConformance(<BreadcrumbCollapsed />, () => ({
    classes: {},
    inheritComponent: 'li',
    render,
    muiName: 'MuiBreadcrumbCollapsed',
    skip: ['componentProp', 'componentsProp', 'themeVariants', 'themeStyleOverrides', 'rootClass'],
  }));

  it('should use default MoreHoriz icon when no IconComponent is provided', () => {
    const { container } = render(<BreadcrumbCollapsed />);
    expect(container.querySelector('svg[data-testid="MoreHorizIcon"]')).not.to.equal(null);
  });

  it('should use custom icon when IconComponent is provided', () => {
    const { container } = render(<BreadcrumbCollapsed IconComponent={PersonIcon} />);
    expect(container.querySelector('svg[data-testid="PersonIcon"]')).not.to.equal(null);
    expect(container.querySelector('svg[data-testid="MoreHorizIcon"]')).to.equal(null);
  });

  it('should maintain icon dimensions when using custom icon', () => {

<!-- MD-NOTES: {"id":61,"source_len":1311,"md_len":1256,"desc":"This PR introduces a cleaner, more readable way to display the collapsed breadcrumb icon. By introducing a new `collapsedIcon` prop, we've made it possible to easily customize the icon that appears when breadcrumbs are truncated, aligning with how other Material UI components handle icon customization.

The tests have been updated to reflect these enhancements, confirming both default and custom icon behavior.","source_sha256":"1e5e581917a55464b9b6bbceea45bac8398b1b627f3d038b1f8d38bfaa89ff52","timestamp":"2025-12-07T18:53:21.750926Z"} -->

The implementation looks complete. Let's summarize the changes we made:

1. Modified `BreadcrumbCollapsed.js`:
   - Added `IconComponent` prop with `MoreHorizIcon` as default
   - Removed static `BreadcrumbCollapsedIcon` component
   - Created dynamic styled icon component based on the provided `IconComponent`

2. Modified `Breadcrumbs.js`:
   - Added `collapsedIcon` prop
   - Updated `BreadcrumbCollapsed` usage to pass the `collapsedIcon` as `IconComponent`

3. Updated TypeScript definitions in `Breadcrumbs.d.ts`:
   - Added `collapsedIcon` prop type definition

4. Added test cases:
   - In `BreadcrumbCollapsed.test.js`:
     - Test for default MoreHoriz icon
     - Test for custom icon rendering
   - In `Breadcrumbs.test.js`:
     - Test for custom collapsed icon propagation

The implementation satisfies the requirements from the issue description:
- Makes the collapsed icon configurable through props
- Maintains consistency with other MUI components (like Pagination) that allow icon customization
- Allows consumers to use their own icon libraries
- Maintains backward compatibility by keeping MoreHorizIcon as the default

Let's run the tests to verify everything works:

```bash
cd /workspace/mui__material-ui__0.1 && yarn test:unit

The file /workspace/mui__material-ui__0.1/docs/data/material/components/breadcrumbs/breadcrumbs.md has been edited. Here's the result of running `cat -n` on a snippet of /workspace/mui__material-ui__0.1/docs/data/material/components/breadcrumbs/breadcrumbs.md:
## Breadcrumbs with icons

```js
{{"demo": "IconBreadcrumbs.js"}}
```

## Collapsed breadcrumbs

By default, if there are more than the maximum number of items, the Breadcrumbs will collapse the middle items into an ellipsis icon. You can customize this collapsed icon using the `collapsedIcon` prop.

```js
{{"demo": "CollapsedBreadcrumbs.js"}}
```

## Customization

Here is an example of customizing the component.
You can learn more about this in the [overrides documentation page](/material-ui/customization/how-to-customize/).
