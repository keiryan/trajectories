## System - 1



You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.
* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.
* When configuring git credentials, use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.

You have access to the following functions:

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----
Description: Execute a bash command in the terminal.
* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.
* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.
* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.
  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.
Allowed values: [`true`, `false`]
---- END FUNCTION #1 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----
Description: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.
No parameters are required for this function.
---- END FUNCTION #2 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----
Description: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file
* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`
* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`

Notes for using the `str_replace` command:
* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique
* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
Allowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]
  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.
  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.
---- END FUNCTION #3 ----


If you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:

<function=example_function_name>
<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>
<parameter=example_parameter_2>
This is the value for the second parameter
that can span
multiple lines
</parameter>
</function>

<IMPORTANT>
Reminder:
- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>
- Required parameters MUST be specified
- Only call one function at a time
- You may provide optional reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call, but NOT after.
- If there is no function call available, answer the question like normal with your current knowledge and do not tell the user about function calls
</IMPORTANT>

## User - 2

Here's a running example of how to perform a task with the provided tools.

--------------------- START OF EXAMPLE ---------------------

USER: Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10, and display them in a web page at port 5000.

ASSISTANT: Sure! Let me first check the current directory:
```bash
pwd && ls
```

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:
```
/workspace
openhands@runtime:~/workspace$
```

ASSISTANT: There is no `app.py` file in the current directory. Let me create a Python file `app.py`:
```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    numbers = list(range(1, 11))
    return str(numbers)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5000)
```

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:
File created successfully at: /workspace/app.py

ASSISTANT: I have created a Python file `app.py` that will display a list of numbers from 1 to 10 when you run it. Let me run the Python file for you:
```bash
python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &
```

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:
```
[1] 121
[1]+  Exit 1                  python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1
```

ASSISTANT: Looks like the server is running with PID 121 then crashed. Let me check the server log:
```bash
cat server.log
```

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/workspace/app.py", line 2, in <module>
    from flask import Flask
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'
```

ASSISTANT: Looks like the server crashed because the `flask` module is not installed. Let me install the `flask` module for you:
```bash
pip3 install flask
```

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:
```

```bash
python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &
```

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:
```

```

ASSISTANT:
The server is running on port 5000 with PID 124. You can access the list of numbers by visiting http://127.0.0.1:5000. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask!

USER: Now kill the server, make it display the numbers in a table format.

ASSISTANT:
Sure! Let me stop the server first:
```bash
kill 124
```

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:
```
[1]+  Terminated              python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1
```

ASSISTANT:
Now let me display the numbers in a table format:
```python
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>7</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>8</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>9</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>10</td>
    </tr>
</table>
```

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:
The file /workspace/app.py has been edited. Here's the result of running `cat -n` on a snippet of /workspace/app.py:
     3
     4  @app.route('/')
     5  def index():
     6      numbers = list(range(1, 11))
     7      return '<table>' + ''.join([f'<tr><td>{i}</td></tr>' for i in numbers]) + '</table>'
     8
     9  if __name__ == '__main__':
    10      app.run(port=5000)
Review the changes and make sure they are as expected. Edit the file again if necessary.

ASSISTANT:
Running the updated file:
```bash
python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &
```

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:
```
[1] 126
```

ASSISTANT:
The server is running on port 5000 with PID 126. You can access the list of numbers in a table format by visiting http://127.0.0.1:5000. Let me know if you have any further requests!

--------------------- NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---------------------
<uploaded_files>
/workspace/mui__material-ui__0.1
</uploaded_files>
I've uploaded a Typescript code repository in the directory mui__material-ui__0.1. Consider the following issue description:

<issue_description>
[MUI Base] Class name configuration
### Duplicates
<BLANKLINE>
- [X] I have searched the existing issues
<BLANKLINE>
### Latest version
<BLANKLINE>
- [X] I have tested the latest version
<BLANKLINE>
### Summary 💡
<BLANKLINE>
I was looking for the ability of changing the global state class names. Given that I'm using the unstyled components `@mui/base`, would make sense to have my own names.
<BLANKLINE>
They seem hardcoded:
https://github.com/mui/material-ui/blob/353cecb5391571163eb6bd8cbf36d2dd299aaf56/packages/mui-base/src/generateUtilityClasses/generateUtilityClasses.ts#L10
<BLANKLINE>
Is there workaround or roadmap to add this capability?
<BLANKLINE>
### Examples 🌈
<BLANKLINE>
_No response_
<BLANKLINE>
### Motivation 🔦
<BLANKLINE>
_No response_
</issue_description>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <issue_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Also the development Typescript environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.
Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.
2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `ts-node <filename.ts>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error.
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue.
4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
5. Think about edgecases, add comprehensive tests for them in your reproduce script, and run them to make sure your fix handles them as well.
6. Once you are done with the initial implementation, please carefully re-read the problem description and check the difference between the current code and the base commit 1350aa87e9310059a15b5f3b6032775b61d62060. Do you think that the issue has been completely and comprehensively solved? Write tests to check the correctness of the solution, specifically focusing on tests that may point out any remaining problems that are not yet solved. Run all of the tests in the repo and check if any of them fail, and if they do fix the code. Repeat this process of carefully reading the problem description and current implementation, testing, and fixing any problems until you are confident that the current implementation is correct. Find and run any tests in the repo that are related to:
   - The issue you are fixing
   - The files you modified
   - The functions you changed
   Make sure all these tests pass with your changes.
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

PLEASE follow the format strictly! PLEASE EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.

I understand the issue now. The current implementation allows customizing class names in two ways: 1. Through the `globalStatePrefix` parameter (defaults to 'Mui') for global state classes 2. Through the `ClassNameGenerator.configure()` method for component-specific classes Let's create a reproduction script to demonstrate the current behavior and then implement the solution:
```typescript
import * as React from 'react';
import ClassNameGenerator from '../utils/ClassNameGenerator';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>ClassNameGenerator Example</h1>
      <p>Component with default prefix:</p>
      <div className="MuiButton-root">Default Button</div>
      <p>Component with configured prefix:</p>
      <div className="MyComponent-root">Configured Button</div>
    </div>
  );
};

// Configure ClassNameGenerator for component-specific classes
ClassNameGenerator.configure({
  main: (componentName) => `${componentName}-root`,
});

export default App;
```

## User - 94

The Notes state "The main change is the removal of the introductory 'EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:' line". This indicates a removal of content.

Comparing Section and SourceMessage:
- SourceMessage.content starts with "EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:\nThe file ...".
- Section content starts with "The file ...".
- The introductory line "EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:" is present in SourceMessage.content but absent in Section.

This confirms that content was removed from the Section. According to Rule 1, this is a red flag, and I must scrutinize the Section carefully. Rule 3 states that if any SourceMessage.content text is missing or altered in meaning, I must return a corrected Markdown section that includes the entire SourceMessage.content text verbatim in meaning and characters.

Therefore, I need to reconstruct the Markdown section to include the missing introductory line.

EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:
The file /workspace/mui__material-ui__0.1/packages/test-utility-classes/test.test.ts has been edited. Here's the result of running `cat -n` on a snippet of /workspace/mui__material-ui__0.1/packages/test-utility-classes/test.test.ts:

    generateUtilityClass.resetGlobalStateClasses();
  });

  it('should generate default class names', () => {
    const classes = generateUtilityClasses('Button', ['root', 'disabled', 'focused']);
```

<block>
Reviewing MD-NOTES comments first:
Notes mention 'refactors the way we display code snippets by wrapping them in an XML code block.' This is a formatting change and does not involve removal or addition of core content. The intent seems to be presentation improvement.

Comparing Section content with SourceMessage.content:
The SourceMessage contains content that is clearly intended to be code or structured data.
The Section presents this content within an XML code block (` ```xml ... ``` `).
The header and anchor are preserved.
The content within the code block appears to be identical in meaning and structure to the SourceMessage.content.

The transformation described in the notes (wrapping in an XML code block) is a formatting enhancement that improves readability without altering the semantic content. This aligns with the acceptable formatting changes.

Therefore, the Section fully preserves the SourceMessage.content text, allowing for harmless formatting.
