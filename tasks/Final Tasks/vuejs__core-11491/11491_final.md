## System - 1



You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.
* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.
* When configuring git credentials, use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.
You have access to the following functions:

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----
Description: Execute a bash command in the terminal.
* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.
* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.
* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.
  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.
Allowed values: [`true`, `false`]
---- END FUNCTION #1 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----
Description: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.
No parameters are required for this function.
---- END FUNCTION #2 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----
Description: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file
* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`
* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`

Notes for using the `str_replace` command:
* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique
* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
Allowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]
  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.
  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.
---- END FUNCTION #3 ----


If you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:

<function=example_function_name>
<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>
<parameter=example_parameter_2>
This is the value for the second parameter
that can span
multiple lines
</parameter>
</function>

<IMPORTANT>
Reminder:
- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>
- Required parameters MUST be specified
- Only call one function at a time
- You may provide optional reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call, but NOT after.
- If there is no function call available, answer the question like normal with your current knowledge and do not tell the user about function calls
</IMPORTANT>

<!-- MD-NOTES: {"id":2,"source_len":9318,"md_len":9476,"desc":"The changes in this commit address a hydration mismatch issue that occurs with `v-if=\"false\"` directives within nested slots of external components. Previously, the server-side rendering output included unnecessary comment nodes (`<!--v-if-->`), which did not align with the client-side's virtual DOM rendering.

## User - 2



Here's a running example of how to perform a task with the provided tools.

--------------------- START OF EXAMPLE ---------------------

USER: Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10, and display them in a web page at port 5000.

ASSISTANT: Sure! Let me first check the current directory:
<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
pwd && ls
</parameter>
</function>

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:
```console
/workspace
openhands@runtime:~/workspace$
```

ASSISTANT: There is no `app.py` file in the current directory. Let me create a Python file `app.py`:
<function=str_replace_editor>
<parameter=command>create</parameter>
<parameter=path>/workspace/app.py</parameter>
<parameter=file_text>
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    numbers = list(range(1, 11))
    return str(numbers)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5000)
</parameter>
</function>

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:
File created successfully at: /workspace/app.py

ASSISTANT: I have created a Python file `app.py` that will display a list of numbers from 1 to 10 when you run it. Let me run the Python file for you:
<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &
</parameter>
</function>

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:
```console
[1] 121
[1]+  Exit 1                  python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1
```

ASSISTANT: Looks like the server is running with PID 121 then crashed. Let me check the server log:
<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
cat server.log
</parameter>
</function>

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:
```console
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/workspace/app.py", line 2, in <module>

<parameter=path>/workspace/app.py</parameter>
<parameter=old_str>return str(numbers)</parameter>
<parameter=new_str>return '<table>' + ''.join([f'<tr><td>{i}</td></tr>' for i in numbers]) + '</table>'</parameter>
</function>

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:
The file /workspace/app.py has been edited. Here's the result of running `cat -n` on a snippet of /workspace/app.py:
     3
     4  @app.route('/')

--------------------- NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---------------------
<uploaded_files>
/workspace/vuejs__core__0.1
</uploaded_files>
I've uploaded a Typescript code repository in the directory vuejs__core__0.1. Consider the following issue description:

<issue_description>
Hydration mismatch when using v-if="false" in nested <slot> of external component
### Vue version

3.4.27

### Link to minimal reproduction

https://stackblitz.com/edit/nuxt-starter-s8nc2r?file=app.vue

### Steps to reproduce

Just run the nuxt app, and you can see the warning in console.
![image](https://github.com/vuejs/core/assets/18690631/a445590f-5483-48f6-81cf-ad1104f81436)

It seems that the ssr render output for code `<div v-if="false">test</div>` is wrong, and the output is  `<div><!--[--><!--v-if--><!--]--></div>`, which contains more child nodes than client vdom(`<div><!--[--><!--]--></div>`.

This warning only occured when i use external component(ex. <el-button> of element-ui).  However, it is normal when i use a local component, even if the local compnent is same as the external one completely.

### What is expected?

Fixing the warning of hydration mismatch, the ssr render output shouldn't include `<!--v-if-->`?

### What is actually happening?

Hydration mismatch,  ssr render output `<div><!--[--><!--v-if--><!--]--></div>`

### System Info

_No response_

### Any additional comments?

Maybe this issue is similar to https://github.com/vuejs/core/issues/5834.
</issue_description>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <issue_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Also the development Typescript environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.
Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.
2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `ts-node <filename.ts>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error.
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue.
4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
5. Think about edgecases, add comprehensive tests for them in your reproduce script, and run them to make sure your fix handles them as well.
6. Once you are done with the initial implementation, please carefully re-read the problem description and check the difference between the current code and the base commit 79602f9ecd9559954f844774a90286305b13e056. Do you think that the issue has been completely and comprehensively solved? Write tests to check the correctness of the solution, specifically focusing on tests that may point out any remaining problems that are not yet solved. Run all of the tests in the repo and check if any of them fail, and if they do fix the code. Repeat this process of carefully reading the problem description and current implementation, testing, and fixing any problems until you are confident that the current implementation is correct. Find and run any tests in the repo that are related to:
   - The issue you are fixing
   - The files you modified
   - The functions you changed
   Make sure all these tests pass with your changes.
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

--------------------- END OF NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---------------------

I will start by exploring the repository to understand its structure.

<!-- MD-NOTES: {"id":3,"source_len":214,"md_len":225,"desc":"This PR makes a minor but important adjustment to how code blocks are presented. By wrapping the bash command within XML code fences, we've improved the visual clarity and readability of the output. This change ensures that the command is clearly delineated from the surrounding text, making it easier to identify and copy. The overall structure remains the same, but this formatting enhancement contributes to a more polished and developer-friendly experience.","source_sha256":"c33aa3fd5400f84d416201cca12d504d96d56b0181be37c38a349442591731b9","timestamp":"2025-12-07T21:25:38.899076Z"} -->
1) REVIEW MD-NOTES COMMENTS FIRST - Critical Red Flags:
   - The Notes mention "improved the visual clarity and readability", "wrapping the bash command within XML code fences", and "formatting enhancement". These indicate changes to formatting rather than content. No red flags indicating removal or addition of content.
2) If Section fully preserves the SourceMessage.content text, allowing harmless formatting only (code fences, language tags, line wrapping), return exactly this JSON: {"pass": true}
   - The SourceMessage.content is: "I'll help you resolve the hydration mismatch issue in Vue.js. Let's start by exploring the repository structure:\n\n<function=execute_bash>\n<parameter=command>ls -R /workspace/vuejs__core__0.1</parameter>\n</function>"
   - The Section content, excluding the anchor, header, and MD-NOTES comment, is: "\n\nI'll help you resolve the hydration mismatch issue in Vue.js. Let's start by exploring the repository structure:\n\n```xml\n<function=execute_bash>\n<parameter=command>ls -R /workspace/vuejs__core__0.1</parameter>\n</function>\n```\n\n"
   - The text content is preserved. The agent added XML fences around the function block. The MD-NOTES comment is present. The content is semantically equivalent.

{"pass": true}

<!-- MD-NOTES: {"id":5,"source_len":1221,"md_len":1232,"desc":"This PR introduces a reproduction script to help diagnose a potential hydration mismatch issue with nested slots and `v-if` directives. The code is now enclosed in an XML code block, which significantly improves its readability and makes it easier to parse the script details. This formatting change ensures that the code stands out clearly from the surrounding text, aiding in quicker comprehension.","source_sha256":"f4dc6f14e6f3e26e5e0fd5a5bd036f3cdc71fab753b3ff98a8ddf88ba3f8b0a6","timestamp":"2025-12-07T21:26:33.697532Z"} -->
Reviewing the MD-NOTES comments:
The notes mention enclosing the code in an XML code block for improved readability. This indicates a formatting change.

Comparing SourceMessage.content and Section:
The SourceMessage.content contains the script intended for reproduction.
The Section contains the same introductory text.
The Section then presents the script enclosed in ```xml ... ``` fences.
The content within the fences appears to be identical in meaning and character to the content within the `<parameter=file_text>` tags in the SourceMessage.

The primary difference is the enclosing of the script content within `xml` code fences, which is a formatting change aimed at improving readability. The agent explicitly stated this in the notes. The original content's meaning and characters are preserved.

Therefore, the modification adheres to Rule 2.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<root>
    <parameter name="file_text">
        <value>
            This is a simple example of a file.
            It contains some text.
            And maybe some other things.
        </value>
    </parameter>
</root>
```

Let's also add the template compilation analysis to help us understand the issue:

```xml
<function=str_replace_editor>
<parameter=command>str_replace</parameter>
<parameter=path>/workspace/reproduce.ts</parameter>
<parameter=old_str>
async function test() {
  const html = await renderToString(app)
  console.log('SSR Output:', html)
}

test()
</parameter>
<parameter=new_str>
async function test() {
  const html = await renderToString(app)
  console.log('SSR Output:', html)

  // Also show the compiled template to understand the difference
  const { code } = compile(`<div v-if="false">test</div>`, {

I see the issue. We need to pre-compile the templates for SSR. Let's modify our script to use the compiler-ssr:

```mjs

import { compile as compileSSR } from './vuejs__core__0.1/packages/compiler-ssr/dist/compiler-ssr.cjs.js'

// Pre-compile templates for SSR
function compileComponent(template) {
  const clientResult = compile(template)
  const ssrResult = compileSSR(template)
  return {
    ssrRender: new Function('require', `return ${ssrResult.code}`)(require),
    render: new Function('Vue', `return ${clientResult.code}`)({ withCtx: () => {} })
  }
}

// External component simulation
const ExternalButton = {
  name: 'ExternalButton',
  ...compileComponent(`
    <div>
      <slot></slot>
    </div>
  `)
}

// Local component (same structure)
const LocalButton = {
  name: 'LocalButton',
  ...compileComponent(`
    <div>
      <slot></slot>
    </div>
  `)
}

// App component
const App = {
  components: {
    ExternalButton,
    LocalButton
  },
  ...compileComponent(`
    <div>
      <external-button>
        <div v-if="false">test</div>
      </external-button>
      
      <local-button>
        <div v-if="false">test</div>
      </local-button>
    </div>
  `)
}

// Create app
const app = createSSRApp(App)

// SSR render
async function test() {
  const html = await renderToString(app)
  console.log('SSR Output:', html)

  // Also show the compiled template to understand the difference

  const { code: clientCode } = compile(`<div v-if="false">test</div>`, {

A common error when using `str_replace` is forgetting to provide the `old_str` parameter. This causes the command to fail with an error message similar to the one below.

I apologize. Let's use the create command since we want to replace the entire file:

After analyzing all the relevant code, I can see that the issue is in how SSR handles `v-if="false"` in slots. The problem is in `ssrRenderSlot` where it always wraps slot content in fragment markers (`<!--[-->` and `<!--]-->`) , even when the slot content is empty or just comments.

Let's modify the code in `packages/server-renderer/src/helpers/ssrRenderSlot.ts`. We need to check if the slot content is just a v-if="false" comment before wrapping it in fragment markers.

```typescript
export function ssrRenderSlot(
  slots: Slots | SSRSlots,
  slotName: string,
  slotProps: Props,
  fallbackRenderFn: (() => void) | null,
  push: PushFn,
  parentComponent: ComponentInternalInstance,
  slotScopeId?: string,
) {
  // template-compiled slots are always rendered as fragments
  push(`<!--[-->`)
  ssrRenderSlotInner(
    slots,
    slotName,
    slotProps,
    fallbackRenderFn,
    push,
    parentComponent,
    slotScopeId,
  )
  push(`<!--]-->`)
}
```

```typescript
export function ssrRenderSlot(
  slots: Slots | SSRSlots,
  slotName: string,
  slotProps: Props,
  fallbackRenderFn: (() => void) | null,
  push: PushFn,
  parentComponent: ComponentInternalInstance,
  slotScopeId?: string,
) {
  // Capture the output of ssrRenderSlotInner in a buffer
  const slotBuffer: SSRBufferItem[] = []
  const bufferedPush = (item: SSRBufferItem) => {
    slotBuffer.push(item)
  }

  ssrRenderSlotInner(
    slots,
    slotName,
    slotProps,
    fallbackRenderFn,
    bufferedPush,
    parentComponent,
    slotScopeId,
  )

  // Check if the slot content is just comments (like v-if="false")
  const isOnlyComments = slotBuffer.every(item => isComment(item))

  // If it's only comments, push them directly without fragment markers
  if (isOnlyComments) {
    slotBuffer.forEach(item => push(item))
  } else {
    // Otherwise, wrap in fragment markers
    push(`<!--[-->`)
    slotBuffer.forEach(item => push(item))
    push(`<!--]-->`)

The following command was executed:

```bash
node scripts/build.js
```

The build process involved transforming several TypeScript files into JavaScript modules and writing them to their respective distribution directories. This is evidenced by the output showing file transformations like `/workspace/vuejs__core__0.1/packages/compiler-ssr/src/index.ts → packages/compiler-ssr/dist/compiler-ssr.cjs.js...` and the creation of various `.js` files in `dist` directories, such as `packages/shared/dist/shared.esm-bundler.js`. The output also indicates the time taken for each transformation and the final minified, gzipped, and brotli compressed sizes for some of the generated files.

The command completed with exit code 0, indicating a successful execution.
