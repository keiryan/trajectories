## System - 1



You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.
* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.
* When configuring git credentials, use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.
You have access to the following functions:

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----
Description: Execute a bash command in the terminal.
* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.
* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.
* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.
  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.
Allowed values: [`true`, `false`]
---- END FUNCTION #1 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----
Description: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.
No parameters are required for this function.
---- END FUNCTION #2 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----
Description: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file
* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`
* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`

Notes for using the `str_replace` command:
* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique
* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
Allowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]
  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.
  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.
---- END FUNCTION #3 ----


If you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:

<function=example_function_name>
<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>
<parameter=example_parameter_2>
This is the value for the second parameter
that can span
multiple lines
</parameter>
</function>

<IMPORTANT>
Reminder:
- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>
- Required parameters MUST be specified
- Only call one function at a time
- You may provide optional reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call, but NOT after.
- If there is no function call available, answer the question like normal with your current knowledge and do not tell the user about function calls
</IMPORTANT>

--------------------- NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---------------------
<uploaded_files>
/workspace/mui__material-ui__0.1
</uploaded_files>
I've uploaded a Typescript code repository in the directory mui__material-ui__0.1. Consider the following issue description:

<issue_description>
Can't get correct position after changing spacing of icons in <Rating /> component in v5.
For some reasons, I need to change the spacing between icons in `<Rating />` component, but it causes the component cannot get correct position of each icons.

Here is the demo:

https://codesandbox.io/s/halfrating-material-demo-forked-0lh9f?file=/demo.js:388-393

When you mouse over the second star, the third one will be highlighted.
</issue_description>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <issue_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Also the development Typescript environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.
Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.
2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `ts-node <filename.ts>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error.
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue.
4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
5. Think about edgecases, add comprehensive tests for them in your reproduce script, and run them to make sure your fix handles them as well.
6. Once you are done with the initial implementation, please carefully re-read the problem description and check the difference between the current code and the base commit 6b9cee5d523304e0a8f3c8fd93a380d27be1df76. Do you think that the issue has been completely and comprehensively solved? Write tests to check the correctness of the solution, specifically focusing on tests that may point out any remaining problems that are not yet solved. Run all of the tests in the repo and check if any of them fail, and if they do fix the code. Repeat this process of carefully reading the problem description and current implementation, testing, and fixing any problems until you are confident that the current implementation is correct. Find and run any tests in the repo that are related to:
   - The issue you are fixing
   - The files you modified
   - The functions you changed
   Make sure all these tests pass with your changes.
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

Let me analyze the repository structure and the issue. The problem is related to the Rating component where changing the spacing between icons causes incorrect positioning when hovering. Let's first look at the Rating component's implementation and then create a reproduction script.

Let's check the Rating component's source code:

```xml
<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>find . -type f -name "Rating*.tsx" -o -name "Rating*.js"</parameter>
</function>
```

After analyzing the code, I can see that the issue occurs in the Rating component's hover calculation. The problem is in the `handleMouseMove` function where the position calculation doesn't take into account custom spacing between icons. Let me create a reproduction script to demonstrate the issue:

const CustomRating = styled(Rating)`
  & .MuiRating-icon {
    margin-right: 20px; // Add custom spacing between icons
  }
`;

function App() {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState<number | null>(2);

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Default Rating (should work correctly):</h3>
      <Rating
        value={value}
        onChange={(event, newValue) => {
          setValue(newValue);
          console.log('Default Rating value:', newValue);
        }}
      />

      <h3>Custom Spaced Rating (has positioning issue):</h3>
      <CustomRating
        value={value}
        onChange={(event, newValue) => {
          setValue(newValue);
          console.log('Custom Rating value:', newValue);
        }}
      />

Let me analyze the issue more deeply. Looking at the Rating component's code, the problem is in the `handleMouseMove` function where it calculates the hover position based on the total width of the container divided by the number of stars (`width * max`). This calculation assumes the stars are evenly spaced across the total width, but when we add custom margins, this assumption breaks.

Let's modify the Rating component to fix this:

```javascript

const { right, left } = rootNode.getBoundingClientRect();
    const { width } = rootNode.firstChild.getBoundingClientRect();
    let percent;

    if (theme.direction === 'rtl') {
      percent = (right - event.clientX) / (width * max);
    } else {
      percent = (event.clientX - left) / (width * max);
    }
new_str:
const { right, left } = rootNode.getBoundingClientRect();
    const stars = Array.from(rootNode.children);
    const starIndex = stars.findIndex((star) => {
      const rect = star.getBoundingClientRect();
      return theme.direction === 'rtl' 
        ? event.clientX >= rect.left && event.clientX <= rect.right
        : event.clientX >= rect.left && event.clientX <= rect.right;
    });

    if (starIndex === -1) {
      // If mouse is not over any star, find the closest one
      const distances = stars.map((star) => {
        const rect = star.getBoundingClientRect();
        const center = (rect.left + rect.right) / 2;
        return Math.abs(event.clientX - center);
      });
      const closestStarIndex = distances.indexOf(Math.min(...distances));
      const starRect = stars[closestStarIndex].getBoundingClientRect();
      const starCenter = (starRect.left + starRect.right) / 2;
      
      // If mouse is to the left of the closest star's center, use previous star
      if (event.clientX < starCenter && closestStarIndex > 0) {
        return closestStarIndex;
      }
      return closestStarIndex + 1;
    }

    const starRect = stars[starIndex].getBoundingClientRect();
    const starWidth = starRect.width;
    let percent;

    if (theme.direction === 'rtl') {
      percent = (starRect.right - event.clientX) / starWidth;
    } else {

The changes look good. Now let's create a test script to verify the fix works with different spacing configurations:
