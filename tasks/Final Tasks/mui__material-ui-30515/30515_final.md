## System - 1



You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.
* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.
* When configuring git credentials, use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.
You have access to the following functions:

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----
Description: Execute a bash command in the terminal.
* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.
* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.
* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.
  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.
Allowed values: [`true`, `false`]
---- END FUNCTION #1 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----
Description: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.
No parameters are required for this function.
---- END FUNCTION #2 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----
Description: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file
* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`
* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`

Notes for using the `str_replace` command:
* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique
* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
Allowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]
  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.
  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.
---- END FUNCTION #3 ----


If you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:

<function=example_function_name>
<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>
<parameter=example_parameter_2>
This is the value for the second parameter
that can span
multiple lines
</parameter>
</function>

<IMPORTANT>
Reminder:
- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>
- Required parameters MUST be specified
- Only call one function at a time
- You may provide optional reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call, but NOT after.
- If there is no function call available, answer the question like normal with your current knowledge and do not tell the user about function calls

--------------------- NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---------------------
<uploaded_files>
/workspace/mui__material-ui__0.1
</uploaded_files>
I've uploaded a Typescript code repository in the directory mui__material-ui__0.1. Consider the following issue description:

<issue_description>
[Autocomplete] Allow passing props to a custom PaperComponent in Autocomplete
<!-- Provide a general summary of the feature in the Title above -->
Often in components that allow customizing inner component types, there is a corresponding prop for passing props to that component (e.g. `PaperComponent` and `PaperProps` in `Dialog`). `Autocomplete` has a `PaperComponent` prop, but it does not provide any mechanism to pass props to a custom component. Adding a `PaperProps` prop would allow the custom Paper component to use additional props passed to the component that is rendering the `Autocomplete`.

<!--
  Thank you very much for contributing to Material-UI by creating an issue! ❤️
  To avoid duplicate issues we ask you to check off the following list.
-->

<!-- Checked checkbox should look like this: [x] -->

- [x] I have searched the [issues](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues) of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

## Summary 💡

<!-- Describe how it should work. -->
`PaperProps` would work in the same manner as in `Dialog` -- it would be an object that is spread as props to `PaperComponent` with a little extra work to merge `classes.paper` with `PaperProps.className`. This issue might become moot if customization of inner components gets standardized in v5 to have `slotComponents` and `slotProps` or something similar (see https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues/21453).


## Motivation 🔦

<!--
  What are you trying to accomplish? How has the lack of this feature affected you?
  Providing context helps us come up with a solution that is most useful in the real world.
-->

The lack of this was exposed by a follow-up question in comments on a StackOverflow answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64001279/display-number-of-matching-search-options-on-textfield-input-in-material-ui-auto/64001279. The [example sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/autocomplete-show-number-of-filtered-options-vqub2?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark&file=/src/App.js) uses a custom Paper component to show some additional information about the number of matching options found. This leveraged the `top100Films` variable directly, but in a real-world scenario, those options are likely to be passed to the Autocomplete's parent component in a prop and there is currently no practical way to pass that prop along to the custom Paper component (defining a component inline to close over the prop would cause re-mounting issues).

</issue_description>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <issue_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Also the development Typescript environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.
Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.
2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `ts-node <filename.ts>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error.
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue.
4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
5. Think about edgecases, add comprehensive tests for them in your reproduce script, and run them to make sure your fix handles them as well.
6. Once you are done with the initial implementation, please carefully re-read the problem description and check the difference between the current code and the base commit 6b618938c28cc63728ae3d897d06c87a3c9736d3. Do you think that the issue has been completely and comprehensively solved? Write tests to check the correctness of the solution, specifically focusing on tests that may point out any remaining problems that are not yet solved. Run all of the tests in the repo and check if any of them fail, and if they do fix the code. Repeat this process of carefully reading the problem description and current implementation, testing, and fixing any problems until you are confident that the current implementation is correct. Find and run any tests in the repo that are related to:
   - The issue you are fixing
   - The files you modified
   - The functions you changed
   Make sure all these tests pass with your changes.
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

--------------------- END OF NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---------------------

PLEASE follow the format strictly! PLEASE EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.

## Assistant - 3



I'll help you implement the necessary changes to add PaperProps support to the Autocomplete component. Let's start by exploring the repository structure:

```bash
ls -R /workspace/mui__material-ui__0.1
```

No, the content has been altered. The previous agent has replaced the original command output with a list of file names and directory structures, which is a significant change in the meaning and presentation of the data.

I will now generate the corrected Markdown section.
