## System - 1



You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.

<IMPORTANT>
* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.
* When configuring git credentials, use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.
</IMPORTANT>

You have access to the following functions:

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----

Description: Execute a bash command in the terminal.
* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.
* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.
* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.
  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.
Allowed values: [`true`, `false`]

---- END FUNCTION #1 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----

Description: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.
No parameters are required for this function.

---- END FUNCTION #2 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----

Description: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file
* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`
* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`

Notes for using the `str_replace` command:
* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique
* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
Allowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]
  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.
  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.

---- END FUNCTION #3 ----

If you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:

```xml
<function=example_function_name>
<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>
<parameter=example_parameter_2>
This is the value for the second parameter
that can span
multiple lines
</parameter>
</function>
```

<IMPORTANT>
Reminder:
- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>
- Required parameters MUST be specified
- Only call one function at a time
- You may provide optional reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call, but NOT after.
- If there is no function call available, answer the question like normal with your current knowledge and do not tell the user about function calls

## User - 2



Here's a running example of how to perform a task with the provided tools.

--- START OF EXAMPLE ---

USER: Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10, and display them in a web page at port 5000.

ASSISTANT: Sure! Let me first check the current directory:
```xml
<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
pwd && ls
</parameter>
</function>
```

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:
```console
/workspace
openhands@runtime:~/workspace$
```

ASSISTANT: There is no `app.py` file in the current directory. Let me create a Python file `app.py`:
```xml
<function=str_replace_editor>
<parameter=command>create</parameter>
<parameter=path>/workspace/app.py</parameter>
<parameter=file_text>
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    numbers = list(range(1, 11))
    return str(numbers)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5000)
</parameter>
</function>
```

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:
```console
File created successfully at: /workspace/app.py
```

ASSISTANT: I have created a Python file `app.py` that will display a list of numbers from 1 to 10 when you run it. Let me run the Python file for you:
```xml
<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &
</parameter>
</function>
```

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:
```console
[1] 121
[1]+  Exit 1                  python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1
```

ASSISTANT: Looks like the server is running with PID 121 then crashed. Let me check the server log:
```xml
<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
cat server.log
</parameter>
</function>
```

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:
```console
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/workspace/app.py", line 2, in <module>
    from flask import Flask

```

ASSISTANT: Looks like the server crashed because the `flask` module is not installed. Let me install the `flask` module for you:
```xml
<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
pip3 install flask
</parameter>
</function>
```

--- NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---
<uploaded_files>
/workspace/mui__material-ui__0.1
</uploaded_files>
I've uploaded a Typescript code repository in the directory mui__material-ui__0.1. Consider the following issue description:

<issue_description>
[TextField] Form inputs with secondary color don't get error color on focus
- [x] The issue is present in the latest release.
- [x] I have searched the [issues](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues) of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

## Current Behavior 😯

When focusing a form input, it usually gets highlighted with red if the input has an error. This is true when the color of the input is set to "primary", but not when it is set to "secondary", whereupon the secondary color is used upon focus instead. I don't see why this would be intentional. I guess the problem is related to the css specificity.

## Expected Behavior 🤔

Inputs with errors should always be red by default, both when un-focused and when focused.

## Steps to Reproduce 🕹

https://codesandbox.io/s/empty-violet-c37om

</issue_description>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <issue_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Also the development Typescript environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.
Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.
2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `ts-node <filename.ts>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error.
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue.
4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
5. Think about edgecases, add comprehensive tests for them in your reproduce script, and run them to make sure your fix handles them as well.
6. Once you are done with the initial implementation, please carefully re-read the problem description and check the difference between the current code and the base commit 1b24a942f93a07a7f2073942c6dec91bdd688d75. Do you think that the issue has been completely and comprehensively solved? Write tests to check the correctness of the solution, specifically focusing on tests that may point out any remaining problems that are not yet solved. Run all of the tests in the repo and check if any of them fail, and if they do fix the code. Repeat this process of carefully reading the problem description and current implementation, testing, and fixing any problems until you are confident that the current implementation is correct. Find and run any tests in the repo that are related to:
   - The issue you are fixing
   - The files you modified
   - The functions you changed
   Make sure all these tests pass with your changes.
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

--- END OF NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---

ASSISTANT:
The issue states that `TextField` inputs set to `color="secondary"` do not display the error color (red) upon focus when `error=true`, instead showing the secondary color. This is likely a CSS specificity problem within the styling definitions for input components.

I will begin by exploring the repository structure to locate the relevant component styling.

Step 1: Explore the repository structure.
```xml
<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
ls -F mui__material-ui__0.1
</parameter>
</function>
```

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:
```console
docs/      examples/  lerna.json  LICENSE    package.json  packages/  README.md  tsconfig.json
```

ASSISTANT: The source code is likely within the `packages/` directory. I'll look for core components like `TextField` or related input components (`InputBase`, `Input`, `OutlinedInput`, etc.) inside `packages/`. Material UI usually places core components in `packages/material-ui/src/`.

```xml
<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
ls -F mui__material-ui__0.1/packages/material-ui/src/
</parameter>
</function>

ASSISTANT: The components involved are likely `TextField`, and its underlying input components, such as `InputBase`, `Input`, `FilledInput`, or `OutlinedInput`. Given the issue concerns focus styling related to `color` and `error` states, the CSS logic defining these states is the target.

I will check `OutlinedInput` first, as it's commonly used in `TextField` and its styling is complex. The file should be `mui__material-ui__0.1/packages/material-ui/src/OutlinedInput/OutlinedInput.js` (or `.ts/.tsx`, but for styling logic, I'll search for the component definition file).

Since this is Material UI v4 or earlier (based on the commit structure), styles are usually defined using `withStyles` or within the component file itself, often in a `styles` object.

Let's check the contents of `mui__material-ui__0.1/packages/material-ui/src/OutlinedInput/OutlinedInput.js` (assuming it's a JavaScript implementation or the main component file).

```xml

ASSISTANT: I have introduced the rule `'&$focused&$error $notchedOutline'` with the error color. This rule has a specificity of two class selectors on the root, which matches the specificity of the conflicting `colorSecondary` focused rule (`.MuiOutlinedInput-colorSecondary.Mui-focused .MuiOutlinedInput-notchedOutline`). Since this new rule is defined later in the JSS object (within the `root` entry, and before `colorSecondary` which is defined later, but JSS often resolves nested states last, or relies on insertion order), I anticipate that this explicit error rule will take precedence.

I need to apply the same logic to `FilledInput` and `Input` if they use similar styling definitions that allow `color="secondary"`.

Let's check `FilledInput`.

The fix for `OutlinedInput.js` used `&$focused&$error $notchedOutline`. This selector has specificity 2 classes on root, 1 class on child.
The fix for `Input.js` used `&$focused&$error:after`. This selector has specificity 2 classes on root, 1 pseudo-element.

For `FilledInput.js`, I applied the fix to the `root` background color using `&$focused&$error`. Specificity 2 classes on root.

I will attempt to run tests related to the components modified (`Input`, `FilledInput`, `OutlinedInput`).

By standardizing this display, the execution context is much clearer for the reader, providing a cleaner overall presentation for functional call-outs.","source_sha256":"e8d857e245311e0eef35a7227d61bc893363be0f62ff3afcbd35163054011521","section_sha256":"be32fa9d59dd9d72e6716228484c8d27dc371419c2b63f70b4aebe139633c06d","timestamp":"2025-11-04T13:57:25Z"} -->

I'll help you implement the necessary changes to fix the TextField color issue. Let's start by exploring the repository structure:

```xml
<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>ls -R /workspace/mui__material-ui__0.1</parameter>
</function>
```

<!-- MD-NOTES: {"id":4,"source_len":30083,"md_len":30098,"ops":[],"fences":{"ts":0,"js":0,"json":0,"xml":0,"console":1,"text":0,"bash":0,"":1},"desc":"This structural adjustment wraps the comprehensive output of the directory listing within a standard console code fence. By enclosing the entirety of the command execution results\u2014including the verbose file tree and environmental metadata\u2014in a dedicated block, we significantly enhance readability. This ensures that the fixed-width nature of the console output is preserved, preventing misalignments or inconsistent text rendering across different platforms. The change clearly segments the output as literal log data, making it substantially easier to parse the resulting directory structure.","source_sha256":"f60335a0f6de4d61bb85f3fb4e3edd00a4b3b6500c772a2fb53c429ff375f11c","section_sha256":"1d8b79c76a2624cfa05be7eebb0b068b278c6412f3db93a4a8b72d206c7f875a","timestamp":"2025-11-04T13:58:17Z"} -->

Based on the repository structure, this appears to be the Material-UI (MUI) codebase. The issue is about TextField components with secondary color not getting the error color on focus. Let me create a script to reproduce the issue first.

```xml
<function=str_replace_editor>
<parameter=command>create</parameter>
<parameter=path>/workspace/reproduce.tsx</parameter>
<parameter=file_text>
import React from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import { TextField, ThemeProvider, createTheme } from '@material-ui/core';

const theme = createTheme();

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <div style={{ padding: 20 }}>
        <div style={{ marginBottom: 20 }}>
          <TextField
            error
            label="Primary Color (should be red)"
            color="primary"
            defaultValue="Error state"
          />
        </div>
        <div>
          <TextField
            error
            label="Secondary Color (should be red but shows secondary color)"
            color="secondary"
            defaultValue="Error state"
          />
        </div>
      </div>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!);
root.render(<App />);
</parameter>
</function>
```

Now I need to create an HTML file to host our React application:

```xml

 *
 * - [FormControl](/api/form-control/)
 * - [InputLabel](/api/input-label/)
 * - [FilledInput](/api/filled-input/)
 * - [OutlinedInput](/api/outlined-input/)
 * - [Input](/api/input/)
 * - [FormHelperText](/api/form-helper-text/)
 *
 * If you wish to alter the props applied to the `input` element, you can do so as follows:
 *
 * ```jsx
 * const inputProps = {
 *   step: 300,
 * };
 *
 * return <TextField id="time" type="time" inputProps={inputProps} />;
 * ```
 *

Looking at the TextField implementation, I can see that it's a wrapper around FormControl and various Input components. The error styling is likely handled in the FormControl component since that's where the `error` prop is being passed (line 160). Let me check the FormControl implementation:

```xml

<parameter=command>view</parameter>
<parameter=path>/workspace/mui__material-ui__0.1/packages/material-ui/src/FormControl/FormControl.js</parameter>

I see that FormControl passes the error state through context to its children (line 164). Let me check the Input component since it's the one that should handle the error styling:

I can see the issue now. In the Input component's styles (lines 28-32), there's a specific style for secondary color that overrides the underline color:

```javascript
/* Styles applied to the root element if color secondary. */
colorSecondary: {
  '&$underline:after': {
    borderBottomColor: theme.palette.secondary.main,
  },
},
```

This style is taking precedence over the error style (lines 53-56):

```javascript
'&$error:after': {
  borderBottomColor: theme.palette.error.main,
  transform: 'scaleX(1)', // error is always underlined in red
},
```

The issue is a CSS specificity problem. Let me modify the Input styles to ensure the error state takes precedence over the color state:

```xml
<function=str_replace_editor>
<parameter=command>str_replace</parameter>
<parameter=path>/workspace/mui__material-ui__0.1/packages/material-ui/src/Input/Input.js</parameter>

The changes look good. I've added `:not($error)` to the selector, which means the secondary color will only be applied when the input is not in an error state. This should ensure that error styling takes precedence over the secondary color.

Let me also check if we need to make similar changes to the OutlinedInput component since the TextField in the issue description uses the 'outlined' variant by default:

```xml

Yes, I see we need to make a similar change to the OutlinedInput component. The issue is in the styles (lines 39-43):

```javascript
colorSecondary: {
  '&$focused $notchedOutline': {
    borderColor: theme.palette.secondary.main,
  },
},
```

This style is overriding the error style. Let's modify it to respect the error state:

The changes look good. I've added `:not($error)` to the focused selector in the OutlinedInput component, similar to what we did for the Input component. This ensures that when a TextField has both `error={true}` and `color="secondary"`, the error state takes precedence and shows the error color instead of the secondary color.

Let me also check if we need to make similar changes to the FilledInput component since it's another variant that could be used:

Yes, we need to make a similar change to the FilledInput component as well. The issue is in the styles (lines 39-43):

```javascript
colorSecondary: {
  '&$underline:after': {
    borderBottomColor: theme.palette.secondary.main,
  },
},
```

Let's modify it to respect the error state:

The changes look good. We've now modified all three input variants (Input, OutlinedInput, and FilledInput) to ensure that the error state takes precedence over the secondary color state. Here's a summary of the changes:

1. In Input.js:
```javascript
colorSecondary: {
  '&$underline:not($error):after': {
    borderBottomColor: theme.palette.secondary.main,
  },
},
```

2. In OutlinedInput.js:
```javascript
colorSecondary: {
  '&$focused:not($error) $notchedOutline': {
    borderBottomColor: theme.palette.secondary.main,
  },
},
```

3. In FilledInput.js:
```javascript
colorSecondary: {
  '&$underline:not($error):after': {
    borderBottomColor: theme.palette.secondary.main,
  },
},
```

These changes ensure that when a TextField has both `error={true}` and `color="secondary"`, the error state takes precedence and shows the error color instead of the secondary color, regardless of which variant is being used.

Let me create a test script to verify that our changes work:

I see the npm install is taking a while. Let's try a different approach. Since we're working with the Material-UI source code directly, we can modify the existing test files to verify our changes. Let me create a regression test in the existing test suite:

```xml
<function=str_replace_editor>
<parameter=command>create</parameter>
<parameter=path>/workspace/mui__material-ui__0.1/test/regressions/tests/TextField/ErrorColorPrecedence.js</parameter>

import * as React from 'react';
import TextField from '@material-ui/core/TextField';

export default function ErrorColorPrecedence() {
  const variants = ['standard', 'outlined', 'filled'];

  return (
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', gap: '20px', padding: '20px' }}>
      {variants.map((variant) => (
        <div key={variant}>
          <h3>{variant}</h3>
          <div style={{ marginBottom: '10px' }}>
            <TextField
              error
              label="Primary Color (should be red)"
              color="primary"
              defaultValue="Error state"
              variant={variant}
            />

          <div>
            <TextField

Now let's run the regression tests to verify our changes. First, let me check what test command is available in the project's package.json:

This clear structural adjustment prevents the instruction logic from blending into the descriptive text, making the intended user action instantly recognizable.","source_sha256":"f1084ed808de70b89a95bd861fd7960fa6a9b660060579fa4fc96061dba5e17d","section_sha256":"c3e8d830f842e0c126e88ae64c3e02f3c0005126ea8d95b69ceb4f2ec363e75c","timestamp":"2025-11-04T14:05:20Z"} -->

I see the npm install is still running. Let's stop it and try a different approach. First, let's interrupt the current process:

```xml
<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>C-c</parameter>
<parameter=is_input>true</parameter>
</function>
```

We are now treating the entire sequence, including the command and associated metadata, as a single, cohesive terminal log block. This approach significantly improves the readability of the output by properly grouping environmental context and error details under one structure. Furthermore, the removal of the explicit 'EXECUTION RESULT' prefix cleans up the presentation, ensuring developers can quickly and clearly parse the events of the aborted command.","source_sha256":"36074b2690cb59343594992b94aabec1ef2a94b6150a7d1830fdc881e0c0e8c3","section_sha256":"5103262c4803a06e1e4c8f97894e0699a98e9ce0ab0661b61b497b532fd82930","timestamp":"2025-11-04T14:05:27Z"} -->
